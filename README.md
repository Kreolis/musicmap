# Music Map

## Concept

This small program categorizes your music on your hard drive for later browsing and embeds the genres in an easy-to-navigate visualization to create mood playlists.
It can use several different algorithms and AI models for music indexing.

## Target Group

After database initialization, the user can browse the category space and listen to the music.
The app runs completely locally and does not require an internet connection.

This app can serve to main audiences.
One is artists and DJs with a big collection of music or new music.
A DJ often has new music he has to categorize and analyze.
Here the app can help to fasten up the music selection process.
For artists, it can provide a quick way of getting new inspiration.

The second target is to aid the mental health of the user.
The user can browse trough the music and in a latend mood space to find similar songs.
The program can automatically create a playlist for the selected mood.
